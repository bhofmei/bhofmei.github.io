      <title>Epigenomics Vizualization</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Epigenomics is the study of genome-wide distribtuions of chromatin modifications.
Our knowledge of epigenomics has drastically improved with next-generation sequencing (NGS) with techniques like whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) and chromatin immunoprecifpation sequencing (ChIP-seq).
With the large quantities of data being produced, data vizualization is an important step for quality control and exploration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Numerous software programs exist to visualize genomics data; most popular is the genome browser.
These existing programs focus on a limited subset of data types such as mRNA-seq and single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Beyond ChIP-seq, there is almost no support for intuitively visualizing epigenomics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been working on developing additonal tools, plugins, for the genome browser JBrowse that support epigenomics data.
Specifically, I have created ways to view context-dependent DNA methylation from WGBS. The methylation context is very important to its function, particularly the combination of contexts in a region. Traditional genome browsers require the DNA methylation contexts as separate &amp;ldquo;tracks&amp;rdquo; which makes it extremely difficult to see combinations and patterns.
The &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/bhofmei/jbplugin-methylation.git&#34;&gt;methylation plugin&lt;/a&gt; I have developed allows for all methylation contexts to be displayed on one track with the context differentiate by color.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Small RNA are also important in epigenetics as they can regulate gene expression and impact DNA methylation.
Traiditional browsers support small RNA-sequencing data but are missing features specifically useful for small RNA-seq. Specifically, the size of a small RNA is indiciative of function.
I have developed a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/bhofmei/jbplugin-smallrna.git&#34;&gt;small RNA-plugin&lt;/a&gt; for JBrowse which colors reads based on size and improves visualization by separating reads from the plus and minus strand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, ChIP-seq and similar techniques such as ATAC-seq, DNaseI-seq, Mnase-seq, are supported in JBrowse. However, it is missing features that are useful specifically in epigenomics.
For example, in ATAC-seq, it is beneficial to know strand-specific coverage (not currently support by JBrowse).
I have created a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/bhofmei/jbplugin-strandedplot&#34;&gt;plugin&lt;/a&gt; that easily supports these strand-specific coverage tracks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;biography&#34;&gt;Biography&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a current Ph.D. candidate at the University of Georgia. A trained computer scientist with an interest of biology,
I&amp;rsquo;ve found my passion in bioinformatics. Current research focuses on epigenetics in plants. Specifically I am interested in exploring inheritance patterns in plants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am also very interested in Big Data visualization, particularly for biological applications.
Recently, I have been creating plugins for the genome browser &lt;a href=&#34;http://jbrowse.org/&#34;&gt;JBrowse&lt;/a&gt;. I have created plugins specifically for epigenetics research. I have also developed plugins to improve ease of use.&lt;/p&gt;
