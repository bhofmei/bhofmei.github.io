      <title>Web Application for Undergraduate Genetics Education</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This project is in progress.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developing an interest for web development, this project aims to join my interests: software development and genetics.
This web applicaiton is based on previous software which was used to teach students about codons and frameshift mutations using scenario-based problem solving.
The original software no longer works with current web browsers, so I was tasked with recreating it following current web development practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Built using the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, Node.js, and Angular), this application is visually appealling and simplifies the original user interface so students can focus on the genetics and logic.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Epigenetic Inheritance</title>
      <link>https://bhofmei.github.io/project/epigenetic-inheritance/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With the combination of bisulfite conversion and high-throughput sequencing techniques, it is now possible to generate genome-wide single base resolution maps of cytosine methylation, referred to as whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS).
This has revolutionized the way scientists study epigenetics.
&lt;strong&gt;Epigenetics&lt;/strong&gt; is the study of heritable changes in gene expression that occur independently from changes in nucleotide sequence.
Before WGBS, methylation could only be determined in small regions at a time or at low resolution, but now it is possible to track single methylation polymorphisms across generations.
This technique to experimental and natural populations to understand epigenetic variation and effects of mutations on methylation polymorphisms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am specifically interested in the generation, heritability, and stability of spontaneous epialleles both meiotically and mitotically.
&lt;strong&gt;Epiallele&lt;/strong&gt; describes a heritable allele that varies in chromatin state.
The most interesting, and most rare, of these epialleles are spontaneous epialleles, where the change in chromatin state occurs independent of changes in DNA sequence.
Several spontaneous epialleles are known in plants, such as &lt;em&gt;Lcyc&lt;/em&gt; gene, which causes altered flower morphology, and &lt;em&gt;colorless non-ripening&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;CNR&lt;/em&gt;) epiallele, which prevents pigmentation in tomatoes.
These epialleles have been well studied and documented in the literature, although they offer limited insight into directed applications of directed epimutagenisis and the heritability of epialleles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project aims to determine if epialleles are stable across generations and follow Mendelian inheritance, which are requirements for successful introduction into breeding programs.&lt;br /&gt;
Previous work from the Schmitz lab with &lt;em&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/em&gt; mutation accumulation lines revealed the existence of spontaneous epialleles between early and late generation lines.
Using WGBS from successive generations of two MA lines, I determined that approximately 99.998% of methylated regions in the genome are faithfully inherited to the next generation.
For breeding programs, spontaneous epialleles must also be inherited following Mendelian laws.
With a genetic cross between two MA lines, WGBS was obtained for the parents of the cross and 20 F2 individuals.
The parents only had about 40 distinguishing mutations, which required the creation of a novel algorithm to generate a genetic map using only DNA methylation, termed an &lt;strong&gt;epigenotype map&lt;/strong&gt;.
The epigenotype map allowed me to explore the inheritance patterns of differing epialleles between the parents and approximately half of these epialleles showed expected inheritance.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Epigenomics Visualization</title>
      <link>https://bhofmei.github.io/project/epigenomics-visualization/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Epigenomics is the study of genome-wide distributions of chromatin modifications.
Our knowledge of epigenomics has drastically improved with next-generation sequencing (NGS) with techniques like whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) and chromatin immunoprecipation sequencing (ChIP-seq).
With the large quantities of data being produced, data visualization is an important step for quality control and exploration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Numerous software programs exist to visualize genomics data; most popular is the genome browser.
These existing programs focus on a limited subset of data types such as mRNA-seq and single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Beyond ChIP-seq, there is very little support for visualizing epigenomics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been working on developing additional tools, plugins, for the genome browser JBrowse that support epigenomics data.
Specifically, I have created ways to view context-dependent DNA methylation from WGBS. The methylation context is very important to its function, particularly the combination of contexts in a region. Traditional genome browsers require the DNA methylation contexts as separate &amp;ldquo;tracks&amp;rdquo; which makes it extremely difficult to see combinations and patterns.
The &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/bhofmei/jbplugin-methylation.git&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;methylation plugin&lt;/a&gt; I have developed allows for all methylation contexts to be displayed on one track with the context differentiate by color.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Small RNA are also important in epigenetics as they can regulate gene expression and impact DNA methylation.
Traditional browsers support small RNA-sequencing data but are missing features specifically useful for small RNA-seq. Specifically, the size of a small RNA is indicative of function.
I have developed a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/bhofmei/jbplugin-smallrna.git&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;small RNA-plugin&lt;/a&gt; for JBrowse which colors reads based on size and improves visualization by separating reads from the plus and minus strand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, ChIP-seq and similar techniques such as ATAC-seq, DNaseI-seq, Mnase-seq, are supported in JBrowse. However, it is missing features that are useful specifically in epigenomics.
For example, in ATAC-seq, it is beneficial to know strand-specific coverage (not currently support by JBrowse).
I have created a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/bhofmei/jbplugin-strandedplot&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;plugin&lt;/a&gt; that easily supports these strand-specific coverage tracks.&lt;/p&gt;
